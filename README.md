This web application was created as part of my final year project for Queen Mary University. It involved research into chromesthesia, a condition which allows people to see/experience colour when hearing sound, and creating an application which helped test and attempt to further understanding on chromesthesia and the relations between tone and colour. 

The web application was created using Python for the backend; HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, CSS and Bootstrap for the frontend. The application was created using the Django web framework.





The code for this project is stored in the following location:
==============================================================
The 'project' folder contains the settings for the application;
The 'synesthesia' folder contains the source code for the application





Inside the synesthesia folder:
==============================
The 'views.py' file contains the python backend functions;
The 'urls.py' maps each view function to a url;
The 'models.py' creates tables;
The 'admin.py' registers the tables to the admin site;
The 'templates' folder contains all frontend files




The application is available online. It can be found using the link below:
